# HZAM-J
Hybrid Zone with Assortative Mating, Julia implementation

Starting this repo on 30Jan2022 to develop an integrated HZAM model 
that combines features of HZAM_Sym_Julia_V1.jl and HZAM_release_2.0.R
into a spatial model of hybrid zones with assortative mating and ecological differentiation.

This repo will include these earlier versions, and build one combined HZAM-J that is
ready for further development.

1Jan2023 Note to self: Best not to keep this repo in Dropbox. Rather, clone to each computer, in a folder in Documents called "Github_repos_MacBookPro" or "Github_repos_StudioMac". When starting work, always do a pull to make sure local version is same as Github version. Then push when done working on that computer.
