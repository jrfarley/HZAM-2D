# HZAM
Hybrid Zone with Assortative Mating

Starting this repo on 30Jan2022 to develop an integrated HZAM model 
that combines features of HZAM_Sym_Julia_V1.jl and HZAM_release_2.0.R
into a spatial model of hybrid zones with assortative mating and ecological differentiation.

This repo will include these earlier versions, and build one Julia HZAM_V4
