# To run simulations under the parameters in the paper, you can execute the following,

# results will differ a little bit (but not much) from those shown in the paper.

# and the main script saved the Julia object where the results are stored--this starts with "outcomeArray_set"
# and will be available on Dryad.

# (Note that if the below have "Het" in their name, they were done using the heterozygote disadvantage (underdominance) 
# option for survival fitness. If they do not have "Het" in their name, they were done using the epistasis option.)
